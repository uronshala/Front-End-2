        <p> Gaming computers, also known as a gaming PC or gaming rig, is a personal computer designed for playing any video game. A modern gaming computer is comparable to a mainstream computer with the addition of performance-oriented components, such as high-performance video cards and high core-count central processing units, that sacrifice power efficiency for raw performance. Gaming computers are often associated with enthusiast computing due to an overlap in interests; however, while a gaming computer is built to achieve performance for actual gameplay, enthusiast PCs are built to maximize performance, using games as a real application benchmark.Gaming PCs are often also suitable for other intensive tasks, like video editing.

            Because of the large variety of parts that can go into a computer built to play video games, gaming computers are frequently custom-assembled, rather than pre-assembled, either by gaming and hardware enthusiasts or by companies that specialize in producing custom gaming machines.<span class="wesellp"> Wesell </span> is a company that works with computers.We mostly work with gaming "PC" and service the ones that our customers send to our office.We started selling parts now to make your computer even stronger in games, workflows with softwares, etc. The hardware (hardware) has become so expensive since last 3 years, it's not easy to buy more than once or twice every year because of high prices!
